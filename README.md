# What's in Name

## Description

It explores the [**baby names dataset**](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data) compiled by the [**Social Security Administration**](https://www.ssa.gov/). The data (name, year of birth, sex and number) are from a 100 percent sample of Social Security card applications after 1879. This dataset is a minehouse and contains lots of interesting stories to explore. In this project, I have explored some of these interesting stories around trendiness in names, and estimating a person's age from their name.
